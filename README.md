# Anomaly-detection-in-time-series
A machine learning approach to detect anomalies in a time series data.


Time series data consists of prices of a certain stock over a period of time that can last as long as a decade.
Within such a duration, it is possible that the stock price might either increase exponentially or plummet. In a way, this phenomenon can be considered as an anomaly.
An anomaly where, the price value preceding it and that succeding it are very far from the price under consideration.
